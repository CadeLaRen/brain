-	Fix NL to ignore case and use GNU libunistring as it did in earlier prototype

-	Suspect thought isn't dealing with stderr and should be - logging it, in the same 
way it logs stdout - that may explain our issue in testing with the bash error

-	Complete configuration of auto-tools to allow modification/generation of config.h & installation into the correct directories


- 	Must strip print to stderr/stdout statements from code in daemon - these are probably responsible for server crash once those are closed, and make sure they get closed at the bottom of daemonize() in braind.c

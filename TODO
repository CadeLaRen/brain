-	Fix NL to ignore case and use GNU libunistring as it did in earlier prototype

-	Suspect thought isn't dealing with stderr and should be - logging it, in the same 
way it logs stdout - that may explain our issue in testing with the bash error

NB.  Suggest we use environment on thought-side to relate NL responses back to the correct connection.
